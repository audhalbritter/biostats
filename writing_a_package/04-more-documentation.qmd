## readme.md for GitHub 

Your GitHub repo needs a readme file to explain to users how to install the package and get started.

You can create `readme.Rmd` with 

```{r use-readme-rmd}
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
```

This will create a draft for you to fill in and knit, and set git hooks to remind you to commit both the `readme.Rmd` and the resulting `readme.md` together.
Do not edit the `readme.md` by hand. 
If you don't want any R code in the readme, you can use `usethis::use_readme_md()` instead.

## Vignettes

A vignette is a long-form documentation for your package.
It can be anything from a walk-through of how to use the package to a detailed explanation of the implementation.

Create a vignette with:

```{r vignette}
usethis::use_vignette("my-vignette")
```
 which will modify the DESCRIPTION file, and draft the R markdown file `vignettes/myvignette.Rmd`.
 Fill it in and knit it.

## A package website

[`packagedown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html) is an amazing package that takes your packages help files and vignettes and makes them into a website that you can host on GitHub.

For a minimal website, you need and run

```{r packagedown}
# Run *once* to configure package to use pkgdown
usethis::use_pkgdown()
# Run to build the website
pkgdown::build_site()
```

Commit and push the built webpages, the [configure your GitHub repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) to support publishing (about 5 clicks).

You can even set up GitHub actions to build the website automatically after every push.
