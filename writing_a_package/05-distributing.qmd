# Distributing your package

If your package is in a public repo on GitHub, you don't have to do anything more. 
Users can install it with

```{r install-github}
remotes::install_github("my-user-name/myPackageName")
```

You can also submit your package to CRAN for consideration. 
This is a lot more work than using GitHub for distribution, but will make your package available to a wider audience. 
See the [R package book section on CRAN](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html) for how to do it.
The function `devtools::release()` can guide you through the process.
