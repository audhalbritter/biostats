# System setup

You should use the latest version of R (currently 4.2.0) and a recent version of RStudio.
It is a good idea to have git installed and have a GitHub (or similar) account.

You will also need to install the `devtools` package

```{r devtools, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

This will also install the `usethis`, `roxygen2` and `testthat` packages that we will use.

If you are using Windows, you may need to install Rtools if your package will contain C++ code or similar. 
You can download and install Rtools from  [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) using the defaults.
Rtools is not an R package.
