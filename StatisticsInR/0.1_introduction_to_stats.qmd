## What is statistics?

Statistics is defined as the science of learning from data, and of quantifying and communicating uncertainty.
It is the process of making inference about the population of interest using the information we have obtained from a subset of them, called a sample.
[inference definition should be here]

We use statistics to make sense of data.
It is used across science, social science, and the working world, you will see it in the news supporting or disproving stories.
It is everywhere.
It is so much a part of every day life, that sometimes we can forget what it really means.

[FIGURE: some statistics from a cool news story]

Statistics begins from a desire to measure the properties of an individual in the population and say something about those measurements.
We might want to measure the average number of calls received in a week, the highest amount of rainfall recorded in a week, etc.
One wants to make statements about the properties they measured, that can be generalised and compared.

Statistics give us a standardised way to collect, describe, analyse, and present data.
Statistics also gives us a way to quantify the uncertainty in our estimates.
Uncertainty of our estimates describes how sure we are of our estimates.
When we want to make conclusions about a population from a sample, we are bound to make some errors.
Because we are using incomplete data, the uncertainties in our estimates need to be
accounted for.
Through hypothesis testing, statistics give us the opportunity to obtain such estimates at a given level of confidence.
Therefore, we need to state how sure we are of our estimates by taking the error into account.


## Samples and Population

A **population** is the total number of things that fit in a particular category e.g. if you want to study the average pace of skiers in Norway, the population is all skiers in Norway ever.
You can rarely measure a whole population, particularly in biology.
Therefore, you take a subset of these, called a **sample**, and measure those.

Because you take a subset, it does not represent all individuals in the population. Normally, all members of the subset have an equal chance of being selected and therefore it is sometimes known as a **random sample**.

[Tell us about things beyond the sample they come from we can include an example on height. I have the data so can add when the page is ready.]


## Estimation

A key focus of statistics is an **estimation**.
This is the process of using sample data to make an inference of an unknown quantity of a target population.
Estimation gives us the opportunity to approximate almost everything about populations.
It involves the various methods that use the sample data to compute the properties of the population.

In statistics, an estimation can be classified as **point estimation** and **interval estimation**.
A point estimate is a single value that is used to describe the property of the population e.g. the average age of students in the class is 22 years.
Interval estimation provides a range of values to describe the property of the population e.g., the average age of students in the class is between 20 and 24.

[FIGURE showing point vs interval?]


## Parameter vs. Statistic

**Parameters** are the quantities that are used to describe a population whereas the estimate or statistic is used to describe a sample.
The parameter is the truth and the statistic or estimate is the approximation of the truth.
If we had the all available time and resources, we would be able to collect information from every member of the population.
As such, we can obtain estimates from them, and this is called a parameter.
For example, we could collect the ages of all the students in NTNU and then estimate the average age of students in NTNU.
The average age is then a parameter.
Note that the students in NTNU are our population of interest.

However, if we do not have the time and resources to collect the ages of all the students in NTNU, we can then take a representable section of the students and collect their ages.
The average age of these selected students is a statistic.
If we were able to measure every available member of the population, all the available time, enough resources, situations where taking the entire population will not destroy the target population (unlike that blood test) then we could know the parameter without error.
But this is rarely the case.
In most cases, we can get incomplete data and as such obtain statistics.


## Inference

You can choose to just describe your sample, but often we are interested in more than this.
We want to address wider questions.
We are interested in making a claim about the target population, using the random sample that we have.
This is known as **inference**.

All individuals are different, we have **variation**.
Every time you take a sample it will be different from each other and the population.
The aim of statistics is to represent this uncertainty and variation.
Inferential statistics quantifies this uncertainty in estimates to represent variation.
They provide measures to relate our sample estimates to population quantities.
In this way, we obtain comparable and generalisable results.


## Examples of uses of statistics

### To estimate relationships

Statistics can be used to establish the relationship between two variables.
It is used to establish the causes and the effects of variables by providing statistics that permits this.
For example, statistics can be used to establish the relationship between the amount of dead birds in the forest and the vegetation of the forest, the scores in a
biology test and the number of hours spent in studying biology, etc.

In the figures below, it can be observed that as the number of hours spent in studying biology increases, the scores for the biology test increases.
This kind of relationship is known as direct or positive.
However, if the increase in one variable leads to the decrease in another variable, as can be seen in example of amount of dead birds in the forest and the vegetation of the forest, then this is an inverse or indirect relationship.
In some other instances, there will be no relationship between the variables of interest.

[EMILY: is the use of indirect or direct correct here? From a biological perspective I think of direct meaning one variable has a direct causal effect on another whereas indirect means one variable has a causal effect on another, which in turn has a casual effect on a third, so the first and third had an indirect relationship. In this way, you could have a negative direct relationship. But let me know if you know of a different formal definition]

## To estimate differences

Sometimes, we may be interested to find out if two or more variables are different. Even if we are to obtain the data from a single population; the sample means will always be slightly different.
But since we are making claims about the population based on the sample, it is always important to establish if the difference is due to the effects of the sampling or not.
This leads to the need to find significant differences (i.e. the difference that is not as a result of the data collection procedure).

As an example, a researcher at SINTEF would like to find out the difference in annual rainfall (measured in millimetres) in Trondheim, recorded in 2018 and that of 2019. 
Assuming the annual rainfall in 2018 is 843mm and that of 2019 is 903mm, then the researcher can state that there was an increase (difference) in annual rainfall by
60mm.
But is this difference significant?
Let us have a look at the next use of statistics.


## To test a theory

We all do make claims.
There are instances and situations we can draw conclusions from.
Some of the conclusions are not based on any evidence.
Howbeit, statistics give us a formal way (evidence) to make the conclusion of whether our claim is true or not.

In the example stated in the section above, quantitative methods provide us with the platform to either claim if the was any significant difference or not.
In the next chapter, we will discuss some of these methods that can be used.
