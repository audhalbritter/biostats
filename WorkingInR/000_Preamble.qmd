## About this website

## Structure of the webpages

### Before we start

At the top of each page, you will find the `Before we start` box which tells you what you must already know or be familiar with before you read further. 

### Body

The body of the page introduces the topic(s) along with relevant examples.

### Interactive apps 

R is a language; thus it is **important to practice writing** to learn it better and faster. 
To do so, we have included a set of interactive apps which you may use to try the code. 
Figure \@ref(fig:app0) shows how such an interactive app looks like.
 
```{r app0, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.cap="_Screenshot of an interactive app._", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/app0.png")
```

Sometimes, the app will be pre-filled with the full code ready to run. 
Sometimes the code will be partial or incorrect, meaning that you will have to edit it first. 
In all cases, run the code by clicking the green button `Run Code` in the upper right corner. 
Alternatively, start again from the beginning by clicking the `Start Over` button.

### What's next

At the bottom of the page, you will find the `What's next?` box which introduces the topics to come. You will thus understand that what you have just learned in the present page get to know what the topics you have just learned 

### Literature 

Finally, we provide you with a list of references that support the topic introduced in the pages, details or documentation about the packages, functions or data sets, examples of how what you have learned may be used practically.
