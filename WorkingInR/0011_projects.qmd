## In this chapter, you will

- learn why you should use RStudio projects for your analyses
- set up an RStudio project
- learn how to organise your files within an RStudio project
:::

RStudio allows you to divide your work into projects which are independent from each other.
A project has its on working directory in which you can create specific scripts, load data sets, add external files, activate packages, etc.
For each project, you will thus be guaranteed to work in a dedicated workspace.

Working with projects is a great way to keep things organised.
You do not risk to mix up files or variables with relatively similar names when writing your code, especially if you are not so creative when it comes to naming objects.
You will also find it easy to share your work with others since everything they need (and nothing less or more) is in a project.

For example, if you plan to work with assignments in different courses in addition to the data analyses for your master's thesis, we strongly recommend to set up a RStudio project for each course, and another for your thesis.

To create a project, go to the main menu and select File \> New Project... as shown in @fig-new-project:

```{r}
#| label: fig-new-project
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Creating a new project -- step 1"
#| fig-alt: Screenshot of the start of the RStudio new project wizard
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("figures/RStudio-newproject.png")
```

Click again on New Directory \> New Project, choose a project name and a destination on your disk, eand click the button "Create Project" as shown in @fig-new-project2:

```{r}
#| label: fig-new-project2
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Creating a new project -- step 2"
#| fig-alt: Screenshot of the last stage of creating a new project in RStudio
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("figures/RStudio-createproject.png")
```

Feel free to import in the project folder all the files that you will need later on, such as original data sets, etc.

## Exercise {.unnumbered .facta .toc-ignore}

Create a project for BIO300B.
Call it BIO300B and save it to a convenient location.
