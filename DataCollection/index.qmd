Spreadsheets are an important tool to enter and store data and used in every day life in science.
As useful as they are, there are also many traps and problems with spreadsheets.
Scientists have lost data, because of spreadsheets such as Excel convert names to dates.
Being aware of such issues is key when wroking with spreadsheets.

In this chapter, we will show you *best practice* to design and organize tidy spreadsheets that are readable to humans and machines.
We want you to learn to use spreadsheets that are less error-prone, work well in reproducible workflows and are easy to share with others.
We recommend to apply these practices to datasets from the start, which should prevent tedious editing later.
Also, we do not recommend to use spreadsheets for data analysis or visualization, because it is not reproducible.
