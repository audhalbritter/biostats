# Presentations in quarto


\##todo## migrate to quarto presentations
There are several schemes for making presentations with R markdown.
I like to use the `xaringan` package (others include ioslides and beamer).
To make an xaringan presentation, install the package then (after restarting RStudio) go to File > New File > R Markdown > From Template > Ninja Presentation.
This will open a draft document showing some of the features you can use.
Knit it, then start to edit it.
Everything you have learnt above about formatting R markdown documents, code chunks, figures and tables for documents applies to presentations.
