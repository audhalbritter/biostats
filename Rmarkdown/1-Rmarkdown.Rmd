### Before you start {- .facta .toc-ignore}

The first part of this tutorial will introduce you to R markdown, a tool that lets you combine code and text to  write reproducible documents. 

The second part will show you how author a manuscript, report or thesis in R markdown.

You will need to have installed

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)


# Getting started

## Why you should use R markdown

The traditional way to write a paper is to run the analyses in R or some other software and then copy the figures, tables etc. into a word processor.
Then you find an error in the code or data and need to repeat the process. 
Repeatedly.

This is very inefficient and error prone.

R markdown lets you have the code and the text in one document.
If the code or the data are updated, new versions of the figures and tables are automatically generated and inserted into the corrected document.

This is a much more reproducible process.



## Creating and knitting an R markdown file

An R markdown file is a plain text file.
You can create a new text file, give it the ".Rmd" extension, and start typing.
But it is better to use RStudio.

Go to the "File" menu bar, then "New File", then "R Markdown...".
The first time you do this, you may be asked to install some extra packages. 
Now you will have a pop-up window asking for the Title, author and output format (Fig. \@ref(fig:output-pic)).

```{r output-pic, fig.cap = "Choose the output format", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/output_type.png")
```

You can fill these in now, or edit the document later.
I recommend you start with "HTML" format as is doesn't require anything else to be installed.
When you are ready, click OK, and a new R markdown file will open. 
It will look something like Figure \@ref(fig:rmarkdown-pic)

```{r rmarkdown-pic, fig.cap = "The default R markdown document.", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/rmarkdown.png")
```

You will learn about the elements of this file in section \@ref(elements-of-an-r-markdown-file).

## Knitting the R markdown file

You can see the rendered R markdown document by knitting it.
Click the blue "Knit" button which is above the document.

```{r knit-pic, fig.cap = "The knit button", out.width="214px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/knit.png")
```
The first time you knit the document, you need to save it.

# Elements of an R markdown file

## YAML

The YAML is metadata for the document that goes right at the top of the file.
It can set the document author and title, the output format and many other things.
YAML format can be difficult to get right as it is sensitive to white space.
You can use an RStudio Addin from the package `ymlthis` to help write the YAML.

### R code in YAML

It is possible to add R code to the YAML, for example to show the current date.
The R code needs to be enclosed in quote marks AND back-ticks with an `r` before the code.
If the code contains quotemarks, then they need to be different from the enclosing quotemarks (i.e. single vs double quotes).

```{r r-yaml, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
---
title: "My Manuscript"
output: html_document
date:'`r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %B %Y")`'
---
```

```{r r-yaml-flair, echo=FALSE}
decorate("r-yaml", eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_lines(4)
```

See the data-time tutorial for more about the codes in `"%d %B %Y"`.

### Output formats

R markdown documents can be rendered in many different output formats, including

- presentations (with [`xaringan::moon_reader`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) or [ioslides](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html))
- posters (with [`posterdown`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/posterdown/))
- books (with [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)).
- theses (with [`thesisdown`](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown))

This tutorial focuses on documents like reports.

There is a choice of output format for documents. 
This can be specified when the R markdown file is created in RStudio or by editing the YAML.

Producing an html file to view in a browser is the simplest, as nothing extra needs installing. 
The YAML should look something like this.

```{r html, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
---
title: "My Manuscript"
output: html_document
---
```

```{r html-flair, echo=FALSE}
decorate("html", eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_lines(3)
```

Word documents are also easy; just change the output to `word_document`.
This can be very useful if you have a supervisor or collaborators who cannot cope with R markdown directly, but consider using the [`redoc`](https://noamross.github.io/redoc/index.html) package which lets you convert an edited word document back into R markdown.

Rendering the R markdown file as a PDF requires some external tools (LaTeX) to be installed. 
This can be done with the `tinytxt package`.

```{r tinytxt, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# run this only once
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Then the output format in the YAML can be changed to `pdf_document`.


## Text

Type to make text!
RStudio has a built-in spell checker that will underline words it doesn't recognise in red. 
Go to "Tools" >> "Global Options..." >> "Spelling" to change the language.

Paragraphs have a blank line between them.
It is good practice to write one sentence per line. 
The extra line breaks will be removed when the document in knitted.
If you want to force a line break, put two spaces at the end of the line.

Formatting is generated with some special characters.
For example:

-   \# Title
-   \#\# Subtitle
-   \*italic\* or \_italics\_ = *italic*
-   \*\* bold\*\* or \_\_bold\_\_ = **bold**
-   Superscript m\^2\^ = m^2^
-   Subscript CO\~2\~ = CO~2~

If you don't like formatting the document by hand, you can use the RStudio visual editor by clicking on the grey [Å]{style="color:grey"} above the document.

A more complete list is given in the [R markdown cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).

## Code chunks

Code in an R markdown document is contained in code chunks.

This is a code chunk that loads the penguin data from the `palmerpenguins` package.

````
```{r import, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
data(penguins, package = "palmerpenguins)
```
````

It starts with three back-ticks, followed by braces.
Inside the braces, the "r" indicates that this is a chunk in the R language.
The next word is the optional chunk name.
After the comma are optional chunk arguments.
Then on a new line is the body of the chunk.
The chunk ends with three back-ticks on their own line.

### Making a chunk

You can type the back-ticks and braces needed to make a chunk, but it is easier to get RStudio to insert the chunk.
You can do this with the <span style="background-color: green;color:white;"><sup>+</sup>C</span> button or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> (on a mac <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> ).

### Chunk language

We will just work with R chunks, but it is possible to run chunks in other languages in RStudio, including Python.

### Chunk names

It is a good idea to name chunks.
If you don't, they will automatically be called "unnamed-chunk-n" where "n" is a incrementing number.
This is inconvenient for debugging (you need to work out which chunk is "unnamed-chunk-37") and for working with any image files generated by the document.
In section \@ref(cross-referencing) you will see how to use chunk names to cross-reference figures and tables in your document.

#### Rules for naming chunks

Chunk names should be informative and can contain letters and numbers.
Words should be separated by hyphens ("-").

**Important**

Avoid spaces, underscores, and periods in chunk names.
They will cause all sorts of strange problems.

### Chunk options

There are lots of chunk options, but only a few that you will need to use frequently.
Here are some and their default.

-   `echo` (TRUE) Show the chunk's code in the output.
-   `eval` (TRUE) Run the chunk code.
-   `include` (TRUE) Include the output of the chunk in the document.
- `message` (TRUE) Include messages from R.
- `warning`(TRUE) Include warnings from R.
- `error` (FALSE) If TRUE, shows any error message. 
If FALSE, stops knitting when there is an error in R code.

I leave `message` and `warning` as TRUE while I am writing the document, so I can see any possible problems, and set them to FALSE when I knit the final version.

I sometimes find it useful to set `error` to TRUE as can make it easier to debug any errors in the code.


Chunk options for figures are shown in section \@ref(figure-chunk-options).

Full list <http://yihui.name/knitr/options/>

### Setting default chunk options

Default chunk options can be set for all chunks with `knitr::opts_chunk$set` in the first chunk.
New R markdown files created by RStudio automatically have this in a chunk called "setup".

````
```{r setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
````

This chunk sets `echo = TRUE` for all chunks.
The `include=FALSE` will stop any output from this chunk being included in the output.

### Running a chunk

Code in chunks will be run when the document is knitted (unless `eval = FALSE`), but it is also useful to run the code interactively to check that it works.
You can do this by clicking on the green play buttons at the right of the chunk (Fig. \@ref(fig:run-pic)) or from the Run button above the document.
If the code depends on previous chunks, the grey/green icon will run them all.

```{r run-pic, fig.cap = "The green run chunk icon and the grey/green icon to run all previous chunks.", out.width="220px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/run-chunk.png")
```

### Hiding a chunk

If a chunk has a lot of code, it can be useful to hide it to make it easier to navigate the document.
The grey arrow next to the line numbers will do this. 
Sections of text can also be hidden.


### Environments and working directory

R knits R markdown documents in a new R session.
The environment is empty: the R markdown document does not have access to any objects in your current environment (this is a good thing for reproducible analyses).
This means that any data you want to use in the document needs to be imported by the code in the document.

The working directory for the new R session used when knitting the R markdown file is the directory where the file is.
If the file is in the root directory of an RStudio project, relative paths will work the same way in the R markdown document as from the console.
If the file is in a sub-directory, use `here::here()` to form paths relative to the project root.

## Inline code

In addition to the output from chunks of code, you can insert code directly into text.
Inline code is enclosed by back-ticks and starts with an `r`.

```{r inline1, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
Seven times six is `r 7 * 6`
```

```{r inline1-flair, echo=FALSE}
decorate("inline1", eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_rx("`.*`")
```

<span style="background-color: Beige;">Seven times six is `r 7 * 6`</span>

If you want numbers written as words, use the package `english`.

```{r inline-english, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
Seven times six is `r english::words(7 * 6)`
```

```{r inline-english-flair, echo=FALSE}
decorate("inline-english", eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_rx("`.*`")
```

<span style="background-color: Beige;">Seven times six is `r english::words(7 * 6)`</span>

It is best to keep inline code short to keep the text readable.
One trick is to do all necessary calculation in a previous chunk, so only the name of the object with the result needs to be in the inline code.
If there are many results to report, consider storing them in a list as in the following example.

```{r penguin-stats}
cor_adelie <- cor.test(
  ~ bill_length_mm + body_mass_g, 
  data = penguins, 
  subset = species == "Adelie")

adelie_list <- list(
  #degrees of freedom
  df = cor_adelie$parameter,
  # extract correlation and round
  est = round(cor_adelie$estimate, 2),
  #format p.value with an "=" is the first character is not "<". 
  #See the characters tutorial for more on the stringr package and regular expressions.
  p_val = str_replace(
    string = format.pval(cor_adelie$p.value, eps = 0.001),
    pattern = "^(?!<)", 
    replacement = "= ")
)
```

```{r inline-list, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
Bill length and body mass in Adelie penguins are positively correlated, 
r = `r adelie_list$est` (df = `r adelie_list$df`, p `r adelie_list$p_val`).
```

```{r inline-list-flair, echo=FALSE}
decorate("inline-list", eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_rx("`r [a-z_\\$]*`")
```


<span style="background-color: Beige;">Bill length and body mass in Adelie penguins are positively correlated, r = `r adelie_list$est` (df = `r adelie_list$df`, p `r adelie_list$p_val`).</span>


# Figures, tables and equations

## Figures made in R

Plots can be included with a chunk that makes a figure with either base plot or ggplot.

If you make the plot with ggplot, remember to print it.

```` 
```{r histogram,  fig.cap = "An embedded figure"}`r ''`
p <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_histogram()
p # remember to print the plot
```
````

### Figure chunk options

There are several useful chunk options for figures, including:

-   `fig.cap` figure caption.
-   `fig.height` figure height *in inches* (1 inch = 25.4 mm)
-   `fig.width` figure width *in inches*

## Embedding external images

Photographs and other figures that have been prepared outside of R can be included with a link.

`![Alt description](image.jpg)`

But you have much more control with `knitr::include_graphics()` which lets you set a caption, adjust the size, and more.

```` 
```{r include-figure, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "An embedded figure"}`r ''`
knitr::include_graphics("my_image.png")
```
````

Use the `out.width` and `out.height` chunk options to set the size of the figure.

## Tables

You can make tables in markdown by hand, but it is so much easier to use R.

Simple tables can be made with the function `knitr::kable`.
Several packages, including `kableExtra` and [`gt`](https://gt.rstudio.com/articles/intro-creating-gt-tables.html) can make beautiful tables.

### kable

```{r kable}

knitr::kable(x = slice(penguins, 1:5), #the data for the table
             caption = "The top penguins" # the caption
)
```

### kableExtra

`kableExtra` extends `knitr::kable`, letting you add extra rows of headers, repeating headers if the table spans multiple pages and many other features.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
penguins %>% 
  #rename some columns
  rename(length_mm = bill_length_mm, depth_mm = bill_depth_mm) %>% 
  #replace "_" with spaces
  rename_with(str_replace_all,  pattern = "_", replacement = " ") %>% 
  #capitalise first letter
  rename_with(str_to_sentence) %>% 
  #get first five rows
  slice(1:5) %>% 
kbl(booktabs = TRUE, caption = "The top penguins") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" ", " ", "Bill" = 2, "Body" = 2, " ", " "))
  
```

Further reading on [kableExtra](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf).

## Equations

Equations are embedded in a pair of dollar symbols.
RStudio will show a preview of the equation as you type it.
Equations are written with [LaTeX notation](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics).

```{r equations, echo = FALSE}
read_csv('
What, How, Output         
"Lower-case Greek letters", "`$\\sigma$`", "$\\sigma$"
"Upper-Case Greek Letters", "`$\\Sigma$`", "$\\Sigma$"
"Subscript", "`$\\beta_{0}$`", "$\\beta_{0}$"
"Superscript", "`$\\chi^{2}$`", "$\\chi^{2}$"
"Fractions", "`$\\frac{1}{2}$`", "$\\frac{1}{2}$"
"Roots", "`$\\sqrt{4} = 2$`", "$\\sqrt{4} = 2$"') %>% 
  kbl(booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE)
```

<br>

Here is an example of using an inline equation.

The `$\delta^{13}C$` value ...

<span style="background-color: Beige;">The $\delta^{13}C$ value ...</span>


A double dollar enclosure gives the equation its own line.
For example, this is the equation of a standard deviation that uses several different elements.

`$$SD = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{n-1}}$$` 
$$SD = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{n-1}}$$

When making a complex formula, build one element at a time, often starting in the middle, rather than trying to get it all working at once.

# Towards a manuscript

## Citations and bibliographies

R markdown can add citations and a bibliography to a document.
Use the bibliography field in the YAML to point to the bibliography file.

```{r bibliography, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
---
title: "My Manuscript"
output: html_document
bibliography: reproducibility.bib
---
```

```{r bibliography-flair, echo=FALSE}
decorate("bibliography", eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_lines(4)
```

The bibliography file can be in one of several formats, including bibTeX (\*.bib) and endnote (\*.enl).
Any reference manager should be able to export to a bibTeX file.

### Bibliography placement

By default, the bibliography is placed at the end of the document.
It is a good idea to end the R markdown file with an appropriate header.

```{r bib-pos, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Conclusions

R markdown is cool.

# References {-}
```

```{r bib-pos-flair, echo=FALSE}
decorate("bib-pos", eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_lines(5)
```

The `{-}` stops R markdown from numbering the reference section header.

If you want to move the bibliography, for example because you need to finish with an appendix, you need to use this bit of magic.
You also need to use the output format `bookdown::html_document2` in the YAML.

```{r bib-move, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Conclusions

R markdown is very cool.

# References {-}

&lt;div id="refs"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

# Appendix A
```

```{r bib-move-flair, echo=FALSE}
decorate("bib-move", eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_lines(7)
```

### Citations

Use the citation keys from the bibliography to cite the reference in the text.
So to cite the reference with the citation key "Cooper2017" we would use.


    Reproducible code [@Cooper2017] ...
    @Cooper2017 discuss ... 

The output depends on the csl file.
Using the default author-date style gives

<hr>
<span style="background-color: Beige;">
Reproducible code [@Cooper2017] ...\
@Cooper2017 discuss ...
\
</span>
<hr>

The `citr` package [install from [GitHub](https://github.com/crsh/citr)] makes an RStudio add-in for adding citations to the text from the bibliograpy.

### Citation style

If you don't like the default citation style, or you want to submit a manuscript to a journal with an overly pedantic editor, you can change the citation style by specifying a csl file in the YAML.

```{r csl, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
---
title: "My Manuscript"
output: html_document
bibliography: reproducibility.bib
csl: plos-one.csl
---
```

```{r csl-flair, echo=FALSE}
decorate("csl", eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_lines(5)
```

The csl (Citation Style Language) file defines the citation style.
There are many citation style available from <http://zotero.org/styles>.

### Citation problems

Unfortunately, there can be problems with the bibliography and citation.
Most can be solved by googling the error message.
A few common problems are addressed here.

##### Incorrect capitalisation

Many CLS styles convert the title to title case (i.e. only first letter of the first word is capitalised).
This can be annoying as names (people, countries, species) can be given in the wrong case.

A paper with the title 

`Population ecology of polar bears at Svalbard, Norway.`

may appear as

`Population ecology of polar bears at svalbard, norway.`

This can be fixed by editing the bibtex file, putting braces around the word with capitals that need to be kept.

`Population ecology of polar bears at {Svalbard}, {Norway}.`

##### Accents and other special characters

The tool-chain that processes R markdown files can sometimes fall over with accented characters or other diacritic marks in the references. 
The error message will look something like this

```
! Package inputenc Error: Unicode character ́ (U+0301)  
(inputenc)                not set up for use with LaTeX.
```

One solution is to edit the bibtex file to replace the accented character with an [escaped code](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Special_Characters#Escaped_codes).
For example, the "í" in "Martínez" could be replaced by "\\'{i}".  

## Cross-referencing

Cross-referencing lets you refer to figures and tables in your document.
Once set up, this happens automatically, so you don't need to re-number all the figures when you add or delete one.

Cross-referencing needs to use a bookdown package output, declared in the YAML.

```{r bookdown, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
---
title: "My Manuscript"
output: bookdown::html_document2
---
```

```{r bookdown-flair, echo=FALSE}
decorate("bookdown", eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_lines(3)
```

### Cross-referencing figures and tables

The chunk that made the figure or table needs to have a name (no underscores!) and a caption.

````
```{r penguin-hist, fig.cap = "Histogram of penguin body mass"}`r ''`
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
````

```{r penguin-hist, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Histogram of penguin body mass", fig.height=3, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

To cross-reference the figure made by the above chunk, we need to use this notation.

`Penguins are cool (Fig. \@ref(fig:penguin-hist))`

<span style="background-color: Beige;">Penguins are cool (Fig. \@ref(fig:penguin-hist))</span>

To refer to a table made by a chunk called `penguin-results`, you would use

`Penguins are cool (Table \@ref(tab:penguin-results))`

Note that the `fig` has been replaced by `tab` in the reference.

If you get the chunk name wrong, there will be a warning when the document in knitted, and question marks shown where the reference should be.

`Non-existing figure (Fig. \@ref(fig:no-exist))`

<span style="background-color: Beige;">Non-existing figure (Fig. \@ref(fig:no-exist))</span>

### Cross-referencing equations

To cross-reference an equation, we need to give it a label.

```
$$
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i}}{n}
 (\#eq:mean)
$$
```
Note that the equation must be on the line below the dollars. 
RStudio will try to show the label in the preview - ignore it.
Now the label can be used.
`The mean (equation \@ref(eq:mean)).`

$$
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i}}{n}
 (\#eq:mean)
$$
 
<span style="background-color: Beige;">The mean (equation \@ref(eq:mean)).</span>



### Cross-referencing document sections

You can also refer to other sections of the document using the title/subtitle.
For example, to refer to this section, you would use

`Cross-referencing (Section \@ref(cross-referencing))`

<span style="background-color: Beige;">Cross-referencing (Section \@ref(cross-referencing))</span>

Note that the reference must be written in lower case and spaces must be replaced by hyphens.
Punctuation is deleted.

## Journal-specific formatting

Use the `rticles` package to produce a draft manuscript in a journal-specific format.
Many journal formats are available.

```{r rticles, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library("rmarkdown")
draft("MyArticle.Rmd", template = "plos", package = "rticles")
```

## Line numbers

If you are creating a PDF, you can include line numbers by adding a header-includes section to the YAML.

```{r line-page-numbers, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
---
title: "My Manuscript"
output: bookdown::pdf_document2
header-includes:
   - \usepackage{lineno}
   - \linenumbers
---
```

```{r line-page-numbers-flair, echo=FALSE}
decorate("line-page-numbers", eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_lines(4:6)
```

Other LaTeX packages can be added in a similar way to add extra functionality, for example, pages in [landscape](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25849814/rstudio-rmarkdown-both-portrait-and-landscape-layout-in-a-single-pdf).  

# Other topics

## Child documents

If a document becomes very long, it might be worth moving sections to a separate R markdown document known as a child document.
When the parent R markdown file is knitted, the child file will be included in the output.
The child file can also be knitted separately.

Child documents can be included in the parent document by using the child option in a code chunk with the file's name and path.

```` 
```{r child = "discussion.Rmd"}`r ''`
```
````

**Important**

-   The chunk must be empty.
-   Chunk names in the child R markdown file(s) must be unique and different from the names in the parent file.
-   Any call to `knitr::opts_chunk$set` in a child document will set the chunk option defaults for the rest of the document.

## Too much or too slow code

If code runs slowly, the output of code chunks can be cached, so next time the document is rendered the existing cached results can be used.
The caching system in R markdown can be activated by setting the chunk option `cache = TRUE`.
The caching system can be tricky to set up for complex projects, and the [`targets` package](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) is a much more robust framework for building reproducible analysis pipelines.
See this [demonstration project](https://github.com/richardjtelford/neotomaTargets) for an example of how to set up `targets`.

## Paramertised reports

If you need a template for many reports, for example, showing results for a specific location or time period, consider using 
[Paramertised reports](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html)
which allow you to pass a variable into an R markdown document when it is knitted.

# Troubleshooting

It is normal to have errors when working with R and R markdown.
Problems can be minimised by developing the document and code incrementally and knitting it repeatedly so that errors can be detected immediately.

Here are some common problems.

## Duplicate chunk names

Chunk names must be unique. 
If they are not you will get an error message including the following

```
  Duplicate chunk label 'import', which has been used for the chunk:
```

Identify the offending chunk and rename it.

## More errors to come

Tell me what you find difficult.
