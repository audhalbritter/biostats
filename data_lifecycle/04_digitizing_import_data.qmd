# Digitize and import data {#sec-digitize-import}

## Digitizing data

The first step after data collection is to digitize the data, unless the data was collected digitally.
When digitizing the data, the digital version should reflect the paper version, to avoid having to flip to different sections of the spreadsheet.
Do not change the format, just to have a long table.
This can easily be changed later.


## Proof reading

After digitizing your data, the next step is to proof read.
Proof reading basically means that you make the digital copy of your data reflect the paper copy.
At this stage, the digital spreadsheet can still be edited by hand, if you are correcting for typos and similar issues.

Note that if you discover consistent error (e.g. entering the wrong date for multiple days), it is safer to make these changes using code.

After proof reading we recommend to save your data as raw data, a non-manipulated version of your data.
Indicate in file name, that this is the raw version of the data.
This will later make the process of data cleaning fully transparent.
For example, if you want to share your data later, anybody can see what was done to the data, and if somebody ever wants to clean your data differently for another purpose, this is still possible.
