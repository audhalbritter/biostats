Data often lives longer than a specific project.
The life cycle of data includes several steps from creating data, curation to archiving, find and re-use.
Researchers typically focus more on some of these stages than others.
An important part of the data life cycle is to plan each step from the start.

In this book, we discuss what a data management plan is and then go through each of the steps of the data life cycle.
