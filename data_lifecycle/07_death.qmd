# Data death {#sec-death}

Information contend associated with data and metadata naturally degrades over time.
The availability of research data also declines rapidly with article age.

```{r}
#| label: fig-death
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "90%"

## Loosing data

What would happen if you lost all of your research data?

Here are two cases where researchers lost all their data.

*"I was focussed on creating high resolution, 3D time lapse videos of developing crustacean embryos, so all of my work was digital-based. When I lost my laptop and backups, I lost 400GB of data and close to four years of work. As a direct result I ended up getting an MPhil rather than the PhD Iâ€™d been working towards. I was hoping to have an illustrious career in science and for a time it seemed like everything would be stopped in its tracks."* Billy Hinchen

This is another case.

## Avoid data loss

- Keep raw data 

- Store data in multiple places

- Use physical and cloud services

- Be paranoid!

**Back up** your data in an data repository that is not connected to your computer to avoid data loss.
There are many options for this and they often have private or closed repositories, which means that you do not automatically need to share the data.

Take pictures of paper versions of your data and store them in a save place.
Pictures can be useful for proof reading.
