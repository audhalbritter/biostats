# Data death {#sec-death}

## Backup

**Back up** your data in an data repository that is not connected to your computer to avoid data loss.
There are many options for this and they often have private or closed repositories, which means that you do not automatically need to share the data.

Take pictures of paper versions of your data and store them in a save place.
Pictures can be useful for proof reading.
