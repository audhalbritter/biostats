# Data archiving {#sec-archiving}

## Storage

**Save** your data as plain text formats, with comma or tab deliminator.
We recommend csv files, which is a nonproprietary format.
This means that accessing the file does not require any special software and can be opened in any spreadsheet program.


## Data dictionary and documentation

A dataset on its own is often useless, because it can be difficult to understand what data each column contains.
Therefore, it is best practise to create a **data dictionary** that goes with a dataset (@fig-data-dic).
A data dictionary is a separate file or table that describes the data and explains what each variable means.

This is useful if you want to share your data with collaborators, if somebody else is doing the data analysis for you, or even for your future self in a few years time.
You might not remember exactly what each column means, the units, and how it was measured.

A data dictionary should contain:

- Variable names
- Explanation of the variable
- Unit
- Range/expected min/max

```{r}
#| label: fig-data-dic
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "90%"
#| fig-cap: "Example of a data dictionary"

include_graphics("./pics/data-dic.jpg")

```


Another important part of a dataset is the **documentation** or **metadata** of how the data was collected.
This can be a protocol, a method section in a paper or even a data paper.
What option you choose is up to you.
It is however important that when sharing the data, the user has access to this information.
