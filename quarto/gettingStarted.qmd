# Getting started

## Creating and rendering an quarto file

An quarto file is a plain text file.
You can create a new text file, give it the ".qmd" extension, and start typing.
But it is better to use RStudio.

Go to the "File" menu bar, then "New File", then "Quarto Document...".
(If you don't see this option, check you have quarto installed).
The first time you do this, you may be asked to install some extra packages.
Now you will have a pop-up window asking for the Title, author and output format (@fig-output).
Make sure the "Use visual markdown editor" option it ticked.

```{r}
#| label: fig-output
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Choose the output format"
#| fig-alt: Screenshot of the menu for making a new quarto presentation
#| out-width: 590px
#| out-height: 523px
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/output_type.png")
```

You can fill these in now, or edit the document later.
I recommend you start with "HTML" format as is doesn't require any other software to be installed.
When you are ready, click OK, and a new quarto file will open.
It will look something like @fig-quarto-pic

```{r}
#| label: fig-quarto-pic
#| fig-cap: "The default quarto document."
#| fig-alt: Screenshot of the default quarto document
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/visual-editor.png")
```

You will learn about the elements of this file in @sec-elements-of-a-quarto-file.

### Exercise {.unnumbered .facta .toc-ignore}

Create an quarto document with output format HTML.

## Rendering the quarto document

You can see the rendered quarto document by knitting it.
Click the blue "Render" button which is above the document.

```{r knit-pic, fig.cap = "The render button", out.width="160px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/render.png")
```

The first time you render the document, you need to save it first.

### Exercise {.unnumbered .facta .toc-ignore}

Render your quarto document and examine the output.
If it worked then everything is set up correctly.

For the rest of this tutorial, we will analyse Bergen climate data and make a reproducible report.

To download the data and quarto document, you need to run

```{r}
#| eval: false

#install.packages("usethis") # if you don't have it already.
usethis::use_course("biostats-r/BergenClimate")

```

Then follow the instructions.
This will open the BergenClimate Rstudio project. 
Open the file bergen_weather.qmd and render it. 
The output is a bit of a mess - we are going to make it better!
