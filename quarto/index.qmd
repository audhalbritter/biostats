# Introduction

The traditional way to write a report, manuscript or thesis is to run the analyses in R or some other software and then copy the figures, tables etc. into a word processor. Then you find an error in the code or data and need to repeat the process. Repeatedly.

This is very inefficient and error prone: there is a better way.

Quarto, lets you have the code and the text in one document. If the code or the data are updated, new versions of the figures and tables are automatically generated and inserted into the corrected document. This is a much more reproducible process.

## Quarto and R markdown

Quarto is based on R markdown. If you know how to use R markdown, you know how to use quarto as almost any R markdown document should also work with quarto.

There are several improvements in quarto over R markdown which make it easier to use.

-   No need to remember different behaviour and capabilities of rmarkdown vs bookdown etc.

-   Improved way to set code block options

-   Simplified cross-references
