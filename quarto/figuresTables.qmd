# Figures, tables and equations

## Figures made in R

Plots can be included with a chunk that makes a figure with either base plot or ggplot.

If you make the plot with ggplot, remember to print it.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: fig-histogram
#| fig-cap: "An embedded figure"
#| fig-alt: "A histogram of penguin bill lengths made with ggplot2"
#| message: false
p <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram()
p # remember to print the plot
```

## Figure labels

The label for the figure block must start with `fig-` for the figure to get a figure number and be possible to link to.
See @sec-cross-referencing on cross-referencing.
:::

### Figure code block options

There are several useful block options for figures, including:

-   `fig-cap` figure caption.
-   `fig-alt` alternate text to improve accessibility
-   `fig-height` figure height *in inches* (1 inch = 25.4 mm)
-   `fig-width` figure width *in inches*

### Exercise {.unnumbered .facta .toc-ignore}

The figure of temperature against year is missing a caption. 
Use code block options to give it an appropriate caption.

Many journals require figures to be a specific size so they fit with the journal layout. 
For PLOSone, figures that fit in one column can be up to 13.2 cm (5.2 inches) wide. 
Use code block options to ensure that the figure would fit.

## Embedding external images

In the visual editor, photographs and other figures that have been prepared outside of R can be included with the insert tool by typing "/" on a blank line and choosing "Figure/Image".
This will open an menu to get the path to the image and set the caption etc.
Once you close the menu, you can set the figure size.
This will generate a bit of markdown that looks like.

`![Marine diatoms](Pics/Marine_diatoms_SEM2.jpg){fig-alt="SEM photograph of marine diatoms" width="491"}`

![Marine diatoms](Pics/Marine_diatoms_SEM2.jpg){fig-alt="SEM photograph of marine diatoms - from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Marine_diatoms_SEM2.jpg" width="491"}

Alternatively, you can use `knitr::include_graphics()` in a regular code block.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: fig-include-figure
#| out-width: "491px"
#| fig-cap: "An embedded figure of diatoms"
#| fig-alt: "An embedded figure of diatoms"
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/Marine_diatoms_SEM2.jpg")
```

Use the `out.width` and `out.height` chunk options to set the display size of the figure.


## Tables

You can make tables in markdown by hand (the <kbd>/</kbd> insert tool helps a lot), but it often so much easier to use R.

Simple tables can be made with the function `knitr::kable`.
Several packages, including `kableExtra` and `gt` can make beautiful tables.

### kable

```{r kable}

knitr::kable(x = slice(penguins, 1:5), #the data for the table
             caption = "The top penguins" # the caption
)
```

### gt

The [`gt`](https://gt.rstudio.com/articles/intro-creating-gt-tables.html) package can make more elaborate tables than `knitr::kable()`.

```{r gt}
#| label: tbl-gt
#| tbl-cap: Tables with gt
library(gt)
penguins |>
  slice(1:5) |> # get top few rows only
  gt(caption = "Basic gt table")

penguins |>
  slice(1:5) |>
  rename_with(str_to_sentence) |> # capitalise first letters
  gt(caption = "gt table with more features") |>
  cols_label(Bill_length_mm = "Length mm",
             Bill_depth_mm  = "Depth mm",
             Flipper_length_mm = "Flipper length mm",
             Body_mass_g = "Body mass g") |>
  tab_spanner(label = "Bill", columns = c(Bill_length_mm, Bill_depth_mm)) |>
  tab_spanner(label = "Body", columns = c(Flipper_length_mm, Body_mass_g))
```

::: callout-tip
## Number of decimal places

When reporting real numbers (i.e. numbers that have a decimal part), you need to decide how many digits to display.
Be careful not to show spurious precision.
You can use `round()` to remove unwanted decimals, or `gt::fmt_number()` to clean up one or more columns in a table. 
To control the default number of decimals across the whole document, use `options(digits = 2)` in the first chunk.
:::

### Exercise {.unnumbered .facta .toc-ignore}

Write a code block to make a table showing the mean precipitation and its standard deviation for each month.

<details>

<summary>

Hint

</summary>

`group_by()` and `summarise()` then use any of the table making functions.

## Equations

Equations are embedded in a pair of dollar symbols.
RStudio will show a preview of the equation as you type it.
Equations are written with [LaTeX notation](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics).

```{r equations, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
read_csv('
What, How, Output
"Lower-case Greek letters", "`$\\sigma$`", "$\\sigma$"
"Upper-Case Greek Letters", "`$\\Sigma$`", "$\\Sigma$"
"Subscript", "`$\\beta_{0}$`", "$\\beta_{0}$"
"Superscript", "`$\\chi^{2}$`", "$\\chi^{2}$"
"Fractions", "`$\\frac{1}{2}$`", "$\\frac{1}{2}$"
"Roots", "`$\\sqrt{4} = 2$`", "$\\sqrt{4} = 2$"') |>
  knitr::kable()
```

<br>

Here is an example of using an inline equation.

``` markdown
The $\delta^{13}C$ value ...
```

[The $\delta^{13}C$ value ...]{style="background-color: Beige;"}

A double dollar enclosure gives the equation its own line.
For example, this is the equation of a standard deviation that uses several different elements.

``` markdown
$$
SD = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{n-1}}
$$
```

$$
SD = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{n-1}}
$$

When making a complex formula, build one element at a time, often starting in the middle, rather than trying to get it all working at once.

## Chemistry

Equations are printed in an italic font, which is not great for chemical formulae.
We can fix this with the `\mathrm` LaTeX command which forces roman typeface.

``` markdown
Sulphate $\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}$
```

[Sulphate $\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}$]{style="background-color: Beige;"}

``` markdown
$$\mathrm{CO_3^{2-} + H^+ \rightleftharpoons HCO_3^{2-}}$$
```

$$\mathrm{CO_3^{2-} + H^+ \rightleftharpoons HCO_3^{2-}}$$
