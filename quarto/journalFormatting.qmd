# Formatting for a journal

## Journal-specific formatting

Use the `rticles` package to produce a draft manuscript in a journal-specific format.
Many journal formats are available. 
Currently this is available for R markdown, but not yet quarto.

```{r rticles, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library("rmarkdown")
draft("MyArticle.Rmd", template = "plos", package = "rticles")
```

## Line numbers

If you are creating a PDF, you can include line numbers by adding a header-includes section to the YAML.

``` yaml
---
title: "My Manuscript"
output: bookdown::pdf_document2
header-includes:
   - \usepackage{lineno}
   - \linenumbers
---
```


Other LaTeX packages can be added in a similar way to add extra functionality, for example, pages in [landscape](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25849814/rstudio-rmarkdown-both-portrait-and-landscape-layout-in-a-single-pdf).
