    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe traditional way to write a report, manuscript or thesis is to run the analyses in R or some other software and then copy the figures, tables etc. into a word processor. Then you find an error in the code or data and need to repeat the process. Repeatedly.\nThis is very inefficient and error prone: there is a better way.\nQuarto lets you have the code and the text in one document. If the code or the data are updated, new versions of the figures and tables are automatically generated and inserted into the corrected document. This is a much more reproducible process.\nThis book is written with Quarto."

Make sure the “Use visual markdown editor” option is ticked.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Choose the output format\n\n\n\n\nYou can fill these in now, or edit the document later. I recommend you start with “HTML” format as is doesn’t require any other software to be installed. When you are ready, click OK, and a new quarto file will open.

The colon and space are required. Rstudio will autocomplete the keys.\n---\ntitle: \"My Manuscript\"\nformat: html\ndate: 2022-04-03\n---\nThe YAML can set the document author and title, the output format and many other things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite space\n\n\n\nYAML is sensitive to white space. For example, you must have the space after the colon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday’s date\n\n\n\nWith the keyword today, you can make the document report the date it was rendered.\n---\ntitle: \"My Manuscript\"\nformat: html\ndate: today\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nAdd date and author keys to the YAML of your svalbard_traits quarto document so that the rendered document shows today’s date and your name.\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Output formats\nQuarto documents can be rendered in about 40 formats! The format can be specified when the quarto file is created in RStudio or by editing the YAML.\nProducing an html file to view in a browser is the simplest, as no extra software needs installing. The YAML should look something like this.\n---\ntitle: \"My Manuscript\"\nformat: html\n---\nWord documents are also easy; just change the format to docx. This can be very useful if you have a supervisor or collaborators who cannot cope with markdown directly.\nRendering the quarto file as a PDF requires some external tools (LaTeX) to be installed (you don’t need to learn any LaTeX). This can be done with the tinytxt package.\n\n# run this only once\ninstall.packages('tinytex')\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n\nThen the format in the YAML can be changed to pdf. With PDF documents, it can be tricky to control exactly where the figures are positioned, so I recommend working with html as long as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto, PDF and LaTeX\n\n\n\nQuarto uses LaTeX to make PDFs. You don’t need to know any LaTeX, but you can include some if you want to change the formatting etc. For example, you force a new page, you could use the command.\n\\\\newpage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoauthoring with quarto\n\n\n\nPerhaps the best way to collaborate with coauthors on a quarto document is to use version control for example with GitHub.\nAn alternative is to use the trackdown package to upload markdown files to Google Drive where they can be edited and then downloaded again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\nA comment in an R code block starts with a #, just as in an ordinary R script.\nA comment in the text is enclosed an html comment mark\n<!-- This is a comment  -->\nType Ctrl + Shift + C (⌘ + Shift + C) to get this comment mark.\nIn the source editor, you can select text you want to hide and use this keyboard short-cut to comment it out."

    "section": "\n3.3 Code blocks",
    "text": "3.3 Code blocks\nCode in an quarto document is contained in code blocks.\nThis is a code block that loads the penguin data from the palmerpenguins package.\n\n```{r}\ndata(penguins, package = \"palmerpenguins\")\n```\n\nIt starts with three back-ticks, followed by braces. Inside the braces, the “r” indicates that this block is in the R language. Next, on a new line, is the body of the code block. The block ends with three back-ticks on their own line. In the visual editor, you won’t see the back-ticks, but the code block will start with {r} and have a grey background.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: A code block in the visual editor\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Making a block\nYou can type the back-ticks and braces needed to make a block, but, when using the visual editor, it is easier to get RStudio to insert the block with the insert tool. Type a forwards slash / on a blank line and choose “R code chunk”. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + i.\n\n3.3.2 Block language\nWe will just work with R code blocks, but it is possible to run block in other languages, including Python and Julia, which would have {python} and {julia} instead of {r} at the start of the chunk.\n\n3.3.3 Running a code block\nCode in blocks will be run when the document is rendered (unless eval: false), but it is also useful to run the code interactively to check that it works. You can do this by clicking on the green play buttons at the top-right of the block (Figure 3.3) or from the Run button above the document. If the code depends on previous block, the grey/green icon will run them all.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: The green run block icon and the grey/green icon to run all previous code blocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nRun all the blocks in the document.\nNow double click on the object called bistorta in the RStudio Environment tab so you can view it. These are the data we are working with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nMake a new code block (or blocks) that make a plot showing the effect of the treatment on Bistorta leaf thickness.\n\nHint\nYou can copy and modify some of the existing code rather than writing from scratch. You will need to look at the data.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Block options\nCode block options control how the blocks work and how any output is treated. Options are given in special comments at the top of the block.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: penguins-bill-body\n#| warning: false\n#| fig-cap: \"The figure caption\"\n#| fig-alt: Plot of penguin bill length against body mass by species\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, colour = species)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\nThe figure caption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions format\n\n\n\nThe white space in the block options is critical.\n\nIf you don’t have the space after the #| then the option becomes a regular comment and is ignored.\nIf you don’t have a space after the colon, you get “ERROR: Render failed due to invalid YAML.”\n\ntrue and false are written in lower case (in R they are upper case).\n\n\nThere are lots of block options, but only a few that you will need to use frequently. Here are some and their default.\n\n\necho (true) Show the block’s code in the output.\n\neval (true) Run the block’s code.\n\ninclude (true) Include the output of the block in the document.\n\nmessage (true) Include messages from R.\n\nwarning (true) Include warnings from R.\n\noutput (true) How and whether to include results.\n\nerror (false) If true, includes any error message and carries on. If false, stops knitting when there is an error in R code.\n\nI leave message and warning as true while I am writing the document, so I can see any possible problems, and set them to false when I render the final version.\nI sometimes find it useful to set error to true as can make it easier to debug any errors in the code.\nSome of these block options interact. Use the following widget, which initially shows the defaults, to explore what is shown with the most commonly used options.\n\nSelect your block options\n\n\n\n\neval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninclude\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\necho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmessage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwarning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutput\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock options for figures are shown in Section 4.1.1.\nFor more options see https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nImporting packages produces lots of output that we don’t need to see in the final report. Use block options to hide the output of this block.\nThe code block making the table is giving a message about the grouping. Use block options to make this message go away.\n\n\n\n3.3.5 Setting global block options\nGlobal code block options can be set for all code blocks by including execute with the option in the YAML at the top of the file.\nFor example, this YAML would set echo to be false for the entire document (options for individual blocks could override this).\n---\ntitle: \"My Manuscript\"\nformat: html\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nUse global block options to stop the code from showing in the report.\n\n\n\n3.3.6 Block labels\nIt is a good idea to give code blocks labels which you can do with the label option. If you don’t, they will automatically be called “unnamed-chunk-n” where “n” is a incrementing number. This is inconvenient for debugging (you need to work out which block is “unnamed-chunk-38”) and for working with any image files generated by the document. In section Chapter 6 you will see how to use block names to cross-reference figures and tables in your document.\n\n3.3.6.1 Rules for block labels\nBlock labels should be informative and can contain letters and numbers. Words should be separated by hyphens (“-”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial characters in labels\n\n\n\nAvoid spaces, underscores, periods and other special characters in code block labels. They will cause all sorts of strange problems.\n\n\n\n3.3.7 Hiding a block\nIf a block has a lot of code, it can be useful to hide it to make it easier to navigate the document. It will still be rendered. The grey arrow next to the line numbers will do this. Sections of text can also be hidden.\n\n3.3.8 Environments and working directory\nR renders quarto documents in a new R session. Initially, no packages are loaded and the environment is empty: the quarto document does not have access to any objects in your current environment (this is a good thing for reproducible analyses). This means that any data or packages you want to use in the document needs to be imported by the code in the document.\nThe working directory for the new R session used when rendering the quarto file is the directory where the quarto file is. If the file is in the root directory of an RStudio project, relative paths will work the same way in the quarto document as from the console. If the quarto file is in a sub-directory, use here::here() to form paths relative to the project root."

Use code block options to give it an appropriate caption and alt-text.\nMany journals require figures to be a specific size so they fit with the journal layout. For PLOSone, figures that fit in one column can be up to 13.2 cm (5.2 inches) wide. Use code block options to ensure that the figure would fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code in chunk options\n\n\n\nSometimes it is useful to have R code in the chunk options.\nWe can do this by putting !expr before the R code. For example, this chunk makes the figure caption include how many species there are in the dataset. It could be written with paste() but I prefer glue::glue() syntax - the code in the braces {} is evaluated and included in the sentence.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-r-in-chunk-options\n#| fig-cap: !expr glue::glue(\"Bill lengths of {n_distinct(penguins$species)} species of penguin\")\n#| fig-alt: \"A density plot of penguin bill lengths made with ggplot2\"\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\np <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill = species)) +\n  geom_density()\np \n```\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Bill lengths of 3 species of penguin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting default ggplot themes\n\n\n\nWhen you make a ggplot figure, you can specify the theme you want to use. For example, to use theme_classic(), we could change the previous figure’s code to\n\np <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill = species)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  theme_classic()\np \n\nTo give all the figures in a document a consistent theme, you can set the default theme near the start of the document, perhaps in the code block where the package are loaded, with theme_set().\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ntheme_set(theme_classic())\n\nYou can also set the default font size with the base_size argument to theme_classic(). Now we don’t need to add theme_classic() to every figure. You can learn more about themes here."

This can be annoying as names (people, countries, species) can be given in the wrong case.\nA paper with the title\nPopulation ecology of polar bears at Svalbard, Norway.\nmay appear as\nPopulation ecology of polar bears at svalbard, norway.\nThis can be fixed by editing the bibtex file, putting braces around the word with capitals that need to be kept.\nPopulation ecology of polar bears at {Svalbard}, {Norway}.\n\n\n5.3.2 Accents and other special characters\nThe tool-chain that processes quarto files can sometimes fall over with accented characters or other diacritic marks in the references.
