# Introduction

Writing a thesis requires importing data, writing code to clean, transform, analyse data, and making figures and writing the thesis.
This is done by writing several R scripts and running one script after another producing results and figures.
These scripts then have to be updated, to add new data, transforming the data, changing analysis or adding a figure.
And often several iterations of running the same scripts again and again are needed.
Analysis can take a lot of time, because they are computational demanding or they  are complex and it is difficult to keep track of which scripts need rerunning when one script has been changed.

This workflow is very inefficient and error prone.
And there is a better way.

Targets is a **pipeline tool** which takes care of dependencies in the code and keeps track of outdated code.
When updating and rerunning code, targets will skip parts where the upstream code has not changed, and which is still up to date and it will only rerun the code that is outdated.
Targets ensures that your results always match the underlying code and maintains a  **reproducible workflow**. 
It avoids unnecessary repetition and can save costly running time.


*When is targets useful?*

- When the code has a long runtime because it is slow or complex

- When the workflow has interconnected tasks with dependencies

- When there are different outputs (e.g. presentation and report)
