```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

```

Writing a thesis requires importing data (1), writing code to clean, transform (2), analyse data (3), and making figures (5) and writing the thesis (6; @fig-data-workflow).
This is done by writing several R scripts and running one script after another producing results and figures.
All the time, the code is updated, to add new data, transforming the data, changing analysis or adding a figure.
Often several iterations of running the same scripts are needed and it is difficult to keep track of which scripts need rerunning.
In addition, complex and computational heavy data analysis can take a lot of time especially when it requires rerunning the analysis.

This workflow is very inefficient, non-reproducible and error prone.
And there is a better way.

```{r}
#| label: fig-data-workflow
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Non-reproducible data workflow.
#| fig-alt: Non-reproducible data workflow.

knitr::include_graphics("Pics/data_workflow.png")

```

Targets is a **pipeline tool** which takes care of dependencies in the code and keeps track of outdated objects.
A target pipeline can for example be data import, analysis, making a figure and produce a report (1; (@fig-targets-pipeline). 
When updating and rerunning one part of the code, targets will skip parts where the upstream code has not changed and are therefore still up to date (2).
Targets will only rerun the code that is outdated and ensures that your results always match the underlying code and maintains a  **reproducible workflow** (3). 
It avoids unnecessary repetition and can saves costly running time.

```{r}
#| label: fig-targets-pipeline
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Reproducible targets pipeline.
#| fig-alt: Reproducible targets pipeline.

knitr::include_graphics("Pics/reproducible_pipeline.png")

```


*When is targets useful?*

- When the code has a long runtime because it is slow or complex

- When the workflow has interconnected tasks with dependencies

## Before you start

Use the `checker` function to check what software and R packages you have already installed and what needs updating or installing.

If you have never used the package before run:

maybe first: `install.packages("remotes")`

then `remotes::install_github("richardjtelford/checker")`

<!-- What needs to be in here? -->
To check what you have already installed use:
`chk_requirements(...)`

For this tutorial you will need:

-   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) (version 2022.2 or newer)
-   [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
-   [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ "Download quarto")
-   quarto R package (`install.packages("quarto")`)
-   targets R package (`install.packages("targets")`)
-   tarchetypes R package (`install.packages("tarchetypes")`)

If `quarto` is new to you, have a look at the **Reproducible documents** tutorial (REF to Quarto book) before proceeding here.
