# Why use Git and GitHub?

Git is a **version control system**, which manages the evolution of files.
[GitHub](github.com) is a online tool using the software git to store fiels and track changes.
GitHub can be used with any files but works best with text files, for example R scripts.
Here we will focus on installing and using git and GitHub with RStudio and explain the basic workflow..

Git and GitHub are widely used in industry and academia.
There are many ways to use git and GitHub.
You can

-   use [GitHub to host a webpage](https://pages.github.com/), perhaps one written with Quarto as this book is.
-   use the GitHub's [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) and [discussion](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions) features for project management.
-   search GitHub for examples of how to use a function
-   use GitHub for publishing code
-   use git and GitHub for version control of files. This is the main focus of this book.

## Version control?

Version control makes it is easy to share code, collaborate on the same project, and keep track of all the changes in your code.

```{r}
#| label: fig-final-doc
#| fig-cap: Use version control to avoid the FINAL.doc problem. Cartoon [from Piled Higher and Deeper](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531).
#| fig-alt: "Cartoon showing graduate student saving a file called 'FINAL.doc'. The document is then revised many times before becomming 'FINAL_rev.22.comments49.corrections.10.#@$%WHYDIDICOMETORADSCHOOL????.doc'."
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/gittutorial/phd101212s.gif")
```

The graduate student in @fig-final-doc will likely struggle to identify which is the latest version of the file, what was changed between each version, and why the change was made.

Version control solves these problems.
We make a snapshot of the state of one or more files, and make a message describing what changed.
We can use version control to "time-travel" to an earlier version of our work, perhaps to identify bugs in the code.

## Alternatives to Git and GitHub

Git is by far the most widely used system for version control.
Other systems, such as Subversion, are little used any longer.

There are alternatives to GitHub, such as [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
These offer similar services with both free and paid plans.
GitHub is the most popular and the tools used in this tutorial have been optimised for GitHub.
