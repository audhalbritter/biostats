## What is a branch?

You have forked a repository and are ready to start working on the project. 
Let's talk about **branches**.

A **branch** lets you develop code, fix a problem, or test an idea without affecting the original project. 
A **branch** is created from an existing **branch**, usually from the **main branch** of the project.
Note that **main branch** was previously named master branch, but removed because of the reference to slavery.
Because of this change you might find references to the old name when looking for help elsewhere.

You can work on a **branch**, bravely develop code that works or does not work and it  does not break the code on the **main branch**.
Basically, you can experiment on your own.

If the idea did not work or you have another idea, the **branch** can be deleted and nobody ever needs to know about it. 
Make a new **branch** and start all over again. 
None of this will affect the original project.

If you are working **on your own** project, and happy with the new code, or the idea is tested and working, you can **merge** the **branch** you are working on with the **main branch**.

Let's have a look how to create, use and delete branches.


### Make a new branch in RStudio

In RStudio, click on the **New Branch** button in the Git tab. 
Next to this button it will say on which branch you are.
In this case it is main, which is the default branch.


```{r new-branch}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/fork_branch_tutorial/5_make_new_branch.png")
```
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Give the branch a short and informative name (no spaces) and click **Create**.

```{r name-branch, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/fork_branch_tutorial/6_name_branch.png")
```
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
You are now in the newly created branch.

```{r new-branch-2}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/fork_branch_tutorial/7_new_branch.png")
```


### Code, commit and push to origin in RStudio

Now is the time work in a new or edit an existing file on the project. 
You can work the way it is described in the \@ref(how-to-work-in-git) How to work with GitHub tutorial. Write or edit code, test it, **commit** regularly, add a useful commit message.

Once you are done with the task in this **branch**, test it and **push** it to your **fork** on GitHub. This is the workflow, if you are working on your own.



The file that has a conflict will look like this:

```
### Dragon analysis ###

library("broom")

# Import data
source("R/import_dragon_data.R")


# Run model

<<<<<< HEAD:dragon_analysis 
mod <- lm(body_size ~ body_length, data = dragon)
======
mod <- lm(body_size ~ body_length * temperature, data = dragon)
>>>>>>> issue-5:dragon_analysis 

tidy(mod)

```

In this file the **merge conflict** starts with `<<<<<< HEAD:dragon_analysis` indicating the name of the file.
Then the two different versions of the code are shown, and separated by `======`.
Finally, `>>>>>>> issue-5:dragon_analysis` indicates the end of the merge conflict.

To resolve the conflict, you have to edit this section and remove the conflicting parts.
Basically, choose one of the versions or combine them.
Also remove the conflict markers `<<<<<<`, `======` and `>>>>>>`.

```
### Dragon analysis ###

library("broom")

# Import data
source("R/import_dragon_data.R")


# Run model
mod <- lm(body_size ~ body_length * temperature, data = dragon)

tidy(mod)

```

Save the file, commit and push again.
