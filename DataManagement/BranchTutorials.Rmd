## What is a branch?

A **branch** lets you develop code, fix a problem, or test an idea without affecting the original project. 
A **branch** is created from an existing **branch**, usually from the **main branch** of the project.
Note that **main branch** was previously named master branch, but removed because of the reference to slavery.
Because of this change you might find references to the old name when looking for help elsewhere.

You can work on a **branch**, bravely develop code that works or does not work and it  does not break the code on the **main branch**.
Basically, you can experiment on your own.

If the idea did not work or you have another idea, the **branch** can be deleted and nobody ever needs to know about it. 
Make a new **branch** and start all over again. 
None of this will affect the original project.

If you are working **on your own** project, and happy with the new code, or the idea is tested and working, you can **merge** the **branch** you are working on with the **main branch**.

### the workflow

To understand the **workflow**, let's see how Kingsley is using branches (see Figure \@ref(fig:workflow-branches)).

Kingsley owns a GitHub repo.
He **clones** the repo to his computer (1).
To develop code, he create a **new branch** (2) and makes **commits** (3).
Then he **merges** the **new branch** with the **main branch** locally on his computer (4).
Finally, he **pushes** these changes to his **remote repo** on GitHub (5).
Kingsley then continue the workflow (2-5).

<br/><br/>
```{r workflow-branches, fig.cap="Workflow using branches"}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/branch_tutorial/1_workflow_branch.png")
```
<br/><br/>
Let's have a look how to create, use and delete **branches**.
<br/><br/>

### Make a new branch in RStudio

In RStudio, click on the **New Branch** button in the Git tab. 
Next to this button it will say on which branch you are.
In this case it is main, which is the default branch.

```{r new-branch}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/fork_branch_tutorial/5_make_new_branch.png")
```
<br/><br/>

Give the branch a short and informative name (no spaces) and click **Create**.
```{r name-branch, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/fork_branch_tutorial/6_name_branch.png")
```
<br/><br/>

You are now in the newly created branch.
```{r new-branch-2}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/fork_branch_tutorial/7_new_branch.png")
```
<br/><br/>
If you want to switch back to the **main branch** or another **branch**, click again on the box in the top corner to switch.
Note that you cannot switch to another branch if you have uncommitted changes.
They need to be committed first.


### Code, commit and push to origin in RStudio

Now is the time to work in a new or edit an existing file on the project. 
You can work the way it is described in the \@ref(how-to-work-in-git) How to work with GitHub tutorial.
Write or edit code, test it, **commit** regularly and add a useful commit message.

Once you are done with the task it is time to **merge** your **new branch** into the **main branch**.

First you need to go to the **main branch**.
For this go to the **Terminal** and type:

```
git checkout main
```
<br/><br/>

To merge the **new branch** into the **main branch** type:

```
git merge my_branch
```
<br/><br/>

For the example we had above, where the name of the **new branch** was community_analysis it would be:

```
git merge community_analysis
```
<br/><br/>
The last step is to **push** these changes from the **new branch** to GitHub.
For this, go to the git tab in RStudio and **push** the green arrow.

RStudio also tells you that your **branch** is 2 commits ahead of the **main branch**, which means that you have made 2 commits on this **new branch**.
<br/><br/>
```{r push-to-git}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/branch_tutorial/21_push.png")
```


### Delete branches

Once you have created a couple of **branches**, it will become difficult to track which **branch** you are still working on and which are old.
Generally, you want to delete a **branch** when you are done with it.

To delete a **branch** locally type:
```
git branch -d community_analysis
```
<br/><br/>

To delete the **branch** remotely, type:
```
git push origin --delete community_analysis
```


### Trouble shooting

**Check configurations in the Terminal**

You might want to check the configurations of your repository.
In the **Terminal** you can check the **origin** of your repo, which is from where you **push** and **pull**.
And it will show you if your **origin** is wrong.

Go to the **Terminal** tab and type repo type:
<br/><br/>
```
git remote -v
```
<br/><br/>
The output will look like this:
<br/><br/>
```
origin  git@github.com:kingsleyshacklebolt/magic_dragons.git (pull)
origin  git@github.com:kingsleyshacklebolt/magic_dragons.git (push)
```
<br/><br/>


**Handle a merge conflict**

A **merge conflict** can occur when you are changing the same line in one file differently, for example using two different **branches**.

The goal is to avoid such conflicts and a good strategy for this is to commit often, work in small steps, push and pull regular.
**Merge conflicts** can be avoided if you use separate **branches** for each file that you are creating or editing.

But **merge conflicts** cannot always be avoided.
If it should happen you will get notified in the **Terminal** when you are trying to **merge** the **new branch** with the **main branch**.
The message will look like this
```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in R/dragon_analysis.R
```
<br/><br/>
First, do not panic.
This message simply tells you that you cannot do the merge and there is a merge in the "dragon_analysis.R" file.

Go the the file with the merge conflict, which will look like this:

```
### Dragon analysis ###

library("broom")

# Import data
source("R/import_dragon_data.R")


# Run model

<<<<<< HEAD:dragon_analysis 
mod <- lm(body_size ~ body_length, data = dragon)
======
  mod <- lm(body_size ~ body_length * temperature, data = dragon)
>>>>>>> issue-5:dragon_analysis 

tidy(mod)

```
<br/><br/>
In this file the **merge conflict** starts with `<<<<<< HEAD:dragon_analysis` indicating the name of the file.
Then the two different versions of the code are shown, and separated by `======`.
Finally, `>>>>>>> issue-5:dragon_analysis` indicates the end of the merge conflict.

To resolve the conflict, you have to edit this section and remove the conflicting parts.
Basically, choose one of the versions or combine them.
Also remove the conflict markers `<<<<<<`, `======` and `>>>>>>`.

```
### Dragon analysis ###

library("broom")

# Import data
source("R/import_dragon_data.R")


# Run model
mod <- lm(body_size ~ body_length * temperature, data = dragon)

tidy(mod)

```
<br/><br/>
Save the file, **commit**, switch to the **main branch**, **merge** and **push** to GitHub.

Easy peasy!
