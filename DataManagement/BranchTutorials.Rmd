## What is a branch?

A **branch** lets you develop code, fix a problem, or test an idea without affecting the original project. 
A **branch** is created from an existing **branch**, usually from the **main branch** of the project.
Note that **main branch** was previously named master branch, but removed because of the reference to slavery.
Because of this change you might find references to the old name when looking for help elsewhere.

You can work on a **branch**, bravely develop code that works or does not work and it  does not break the code on the **main branch**.
Basically, you can experiment on your own.

If the idea did not work or you have another idea, the **branch** can be deleted and nobody ever needs to know about it. 
Make a new **branch** and start all over again. 
None of this will affect the original project.

If you are working **on your own** project, and happy with the new code, or the idea is tested and working, you can **merge** the **branch** you are working on with the **main branch**.
<br/><br/>

### the workflow

To understand the **workflow**, let's see how Kingsley is using branches (see Figure \@ref(fig:workflow-branches)).

Kingsley owns a GitHub repo.
He **clones** the repo to his computer (1).
To develop code, he create a **new branch** (2) and makes **commits** (3).
Then he **pushes** these changes to his **remote repo** on GitHub (4) and makes a **pull request** to **merge** the **new branch** with the **main branch** (5).
Kingsley then **pulls** (6) the newest changes into his local repo and continue the workflow (2-5).

```

Let's have a look how to create, use and delete **branches**.
<br/><br/>

### Make a new branch in RStudio

In RStudio, click on the **New Branch** button in the Git tab. 
Next to this button it will say on which branch you are.
In this case it is main, which is the default branch.


```{r new-branch}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/fork_branch_tutorial/5_make_new_branch.png")
```
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Give the branch a short and informative name (no spaces) and click **Create**.

```{r name-branch, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/fork_branch_tutorial/6_name_branch.png")
```
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
You are now in the newly created branch.

```{r new-branch-2}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/fork_branch_tutorial/7_new_branch.png")
```

If you want to switch back to the **main branch** or another **branch**, click again on the box in the top corner to switch.
Note that you cannot switch to another branch if you have uncommited changes.
They need to be commited first.


### Code, commit and push to origin in RStudio

Now is the time to work in a new or edit an existing file on the project. 
You can work the way it is described in the \@ref(how-to-work-in-git) How to work with GitHub tutorial. Write or edit code, test it, **commit** regularly, add a useful commit message.

Once you are done with the task in this **branch**, test it and **push** it to your **remote repo** on GitHub.

IS THIS ALL???
