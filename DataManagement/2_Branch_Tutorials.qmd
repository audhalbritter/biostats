## What is a branch?

A **branch** lets you develop code, fix a problem, or test an idea without affecting the original project.
A **branch** is created from an existing **branch**, usually from the **main branch** of the project.
Note that **main branch** was previously named master branch, but removed because of the reference to slavery.
Because of this change you might find references to the old name when looking for help elsewhere.

You can work on a **branch**, bravely develop code that works or does not work and it does not break the code on the **main branch**.
Basically, you can experiment on your own.

If the idea did not work or you have another idea, the **branch** can be deleted and nobody ever needs to know about it.
Make a new **branch** and start all over again.
None of this will affect the original project.

If you are working **on your own** project, and happy with the new code, or the idea is tested and working, you can **merge** the **branch** you are working on with the **main branch**.

## Definitions

-   **branch** - a space for making changes to code without affecting the original code
-   **merge** - merge the commits on two branches
-   **merge conflict** - a problem when there are two incompatible versions of a file that you are trying to merge
-   **main** - conventional name of the default branch of your repo
:::

### The workflow

To understand the **workflow**, let's see how Kingsley is using branches (@fig-workflow-branches).

Kingsley owns a GitHub repo.
He **clones** the repo to his computer (1).
To develop code, he creates a **new branch** (2) and makes **commits** (3).
Then he **merges** the **new branch** with the **main branch** locally on his computer (4).
Finally, he **pushes** these changes to his **remote repo** on GitHub (5).
Kingsley then continue the workflow (2-5).

#| fig-cap: Workflow using branches
#| fig-alt: Schematic diagram of the workflow when using branches
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/branch_tutorial/1_workflow_branch.png")
```

Let's have a look how to create, use and delete **branches**.

### Make a new branch in RStudio {#sec-new-branch}

In RStudio, click on the **New Branch** button in the Git tab.
Next to this button it will say on which branch you are.
In this case it is main, which is the default branch.

```{r}
#| label: fig-new-branch
#| fig-cap: Icon for making a new branch in RStudio
#| fig-alt: Screenshot of the git panel in RStudio showing the icon for making a new branch
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/fork_branch_tutorial/5_make_new_branch.png")
```

Give the branch a short and informative name (no spaces) and click **Create**.

```{r}
#| label: fig-name-branch
#| out-width: '50%'
#| fig-cap: New branch popup.
#| fig-alt: Screenshot of the new branch popup window in RStudio
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/fork_branch_tutorial/6_name_branch.png")
```

You are now in the newly created branch.

```{r}
#| label: fig-new-branch-2
#| fig-cap: The new branch is now active. Use this drop-down list to switch to a different branch.
#| fig-alt: Screenshot of git panel in RStudio showing which branch is active
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/fork_branch_tutorial/7_new_branch.png")
```

If you want to switch back to the **main branch** or another **branch**, click again on the box in the top corner to switch.
Note that you cannot switch to another branch if you have uncommitted changes.
They need to be committed first.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-mermaid-branch
%%| fig-cap: Representation of your git repo after making some commits on a branch called 'feature'.
gitGraph
   commit id: "a"
   commit id: "b"
   commit id: "c"
   branch feature
   checkout feature
   commit id: "d"
   commit id: "e" tag: "HEAD"
```


### Code, commit and push to origin in RStudio

Now is the time to work in a new or edit an existing file on the project.
You can work the way it is described in @sec-stage-commit-push.
Write or edit code, test it, **commit** regularly and add a useful commit message.


Once you are done with the task it is time to **merge** the work on your **new branch** into the **main branch**.
You can do this either locally or on GitHub.

::: panel-tabset
##  Merging branches on GitHub

The easiest way to merge branches is on GitHub.

First, **push** your commits to GitHub and then open your repo on GitHub.

You should have a green button "Compare & pull request" (@fig-compare-pr).
Click this.

```{r}
#| label: fig-compare-pr
#| fig-cap: Click the green Compare and pull request button to start merging.
#| fig-alt: Screenshot of GitHub.com showing button to start merging branches.
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/branch_tutorial/3_compare_pull_request.png")
```

Now you should see a page with the title "Open a pull request" (@fig-pull-request).
Click on the green create pull request button and follow the instructions on the next page to complete the pull request.

```{r}
#| label: fig-pull-request
#| fig-cap: Click the big green button to start merging the branches.
#| fig-alt: Screenshot of GitHub.com showing the Open a pull request page.
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/branch_tutorial/4_pull_request.png")
```

The final step is to switch to the **main branch** in RStudio (@fig-new-branch-2) and **pull** the latest commits.

This process is similar to the workflow when collaborating with forks (@sec-collaborating-with-forks).

## Merging branches locally

You can also merge branches in RStudio using the terminal if you prefer.

First you need to go to the **main branch**.
You can change to the main branch in RStudio (@fig-new-branch-2), or, go to the **Terminal** and type:

``` bash
git checkout main
```

To merge the **branch** called *community_analysis* into the **main branch** type:

``` bash
git merge community_analysis
```

The last step is to **push** these changes to GitHub.
For this, go to the git tab in RStudio and **push** the green arrow.

gitGraph
   commit id: "a"
   commit id: "b"
   commit id: "c"
   branch feature
   checkout feature
   commit id: "d"
   commit id: "e"
   checkout main
   merge feature
   commit id: "f" tag: "HEAD"
```


### Delete branches {#sec-delete-branch}

Once you have created some **branches**, it will become difficult to track which **branch** you are still working on and which are old.
Generally, you want to delete a **branch** when you are finished with it.

You can delete a branch on **GitHub** either as the last step of merging a branch, or by clicking on the "branches" button and then the dustbin icon next to the branch you want to get rid of.

To delete a **branch** locally, open the terminal and type:

``` bash
git branch -d community_analysis
```

To save you from losing work, this command will not work if the branch has not been merged.
If you really want to delete the branch, use this instead.

``` bash
git branch -D community_analysis
```

::: callout-note
## Exercise

Make a new branch for your repo, then, on the branch edit your code and make some commits.
Then merge the branch with the main branch and delete the new branch.
Look at the git history to see how the branch and its commits are represented (open the git window in RStudio and click on history).
:::

### Trouble shooting

#### Check configurations in the Terminal

If the push and pull icons are in pale green, you might want to check the configurations of your repository.
In the **Terminal** you can check the **origin** of your repo, which is from where you **push** and **pull**.
And it will show you if your **origin** is wrong.

Go to the **Terminal** tab and type:

``` bash
git remote -v
```

The output will look like this:

    origin  git@github.com:kingsleyshacklebolt/magic_dragons.git (pull)
    origin  git@github.com:kingsleyshacklebolt/magic_dragons.git (push)

If this looks right, try running

``` bash
git pull
```

and following the instructions in any error message.

#### Handling a merge conflict {#sec-merge-conflicts}

A **merge conflict** can occur when you try merging branches that both have edits to the same part of a file.
This can happen if you are trying to merge two branches when you have edited the file on both branches, or when you are pulling from GitHub and you (or a collaborator) have edited the file there.

The goal is to avoid such conflicts, or at least minimise them, and a good strategy for this is to commit often, work in small steps, push and pull regularly.
**Merge conflicts** can be avoided if you use separate **branches** for each file that you are creating or editing.

But **merge conflicts** cannot always be avoided.
If it should happen you will get notified in the **Terminal** when you are trying to **merge** the **new branch** with the **main branch**.
The message will look like this

    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in R/dragon_analysis.R

First, do not panic.
This message simply tells you that you cannot do the merge and there is a merge conflict in the "dragon_analysis.R" file.

Go the the file with the merge conflict, which will look like this:

    ### Dragon analysis ###

    library("broom")

    # Import data
    source("R/import_dragon_data.R")


    # Run model

    <<<<<< HEAD:dragon_analysis 
    mod <- lm(body_size ~ body_length, data = dragon)
    ======
      mod <- lm(body_size ~ body_length * temperature, data = dragon)
    >>>>>>> issue-5:dragon_analysis 

    tidy(mod)

In this file the **merge conflict** starts with `<<<<<< HEAD:dragon_analysis` indicating the name of the file.
Then the two different versions of the code are shown, and separated by `======`.
Finally, `>>>>>>> issue-5:dragon_analysis` indicates the end of the merge conflict.

To resolve the conflict, you have to edit this section and remove the conflicting parts.
Basically, choose one of the versions or combine them.
Also remove the conflict markers `<<<<<<`, `======` and `>>>>>>`.

    ### Dragon analysis ###

    library("broom")

    # Import data
    source("R/import_dragon_data.R")


    # Run model
    mod <- lm(body_size ~ body_length * temperature, data = dragon)

    tidy(mod)

Save the file, **commit**, switch to the **main branch**, **merge** and **push** to GitHub.

Easy peasy!
