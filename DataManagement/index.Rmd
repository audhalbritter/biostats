# Introduction

## Why we use version control?

Version control makes it is easy to share code, collaborate on the same project, and keep track of all the changes in your code.

Here we will guide you through the process of installing git, connecting RStudio and GitHub and explain the basic workflow.

Git is a **version control system**, which manages the evolution of files. GitHub is a online tool using the software git to store data and track changes. 
GitHub can be used with any files but works best with text files, for example R scripts. 
Here we will focus on using git and GitHub with RStudio.
